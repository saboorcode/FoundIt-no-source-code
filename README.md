## Inspiration

College students often face the challenge of recovering lost items and finding their rightful owners. Existing solutions are scattered across platforms like Snapchat and Reddit, with no unified approach. **FoundIt** was born to unify this process, offering a simple, cross-platform hub for campuses to post, track, and recover lost items.

---

## What It Does

FoundIt provides a one-stop place for posting and recovering lost or found items in an easy-to-use interface.

**Current Features (Simplified for Hackathon Time Constraints):**

* View a list of actively lost items
* Add a lost item to the list
* View your posted items

*(Future goal: mark items as found or inactive.)*

---

## Future Vision

* **Target Audience:** College campuses
* **Student Portal Authentication:** Admin accounts for colleges and student sign-ups through student email addresses
* **Location-Based Services:** Add location to lost items to improve recovery chances
* **Search Functionality:** Filter and search for lost items easily

---

## How We Built It

* **Frontend:** Svelte, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Express.js, Supabase
* Rapid learning of 2 new technologies during the hackathon

---

## Challenges

* Learning multiple new technologies under time constraints
* Supabase server downtime affecting database testing
* Adjusting the scope to match hackathon limitations

---

## Accomplishments

* Each team member learned at least one new technology
* Thorough planning process as a reliable source of truth
* Working UI prototype with functional routes (local only)
* UI designed for easy future integration with backend

---

## Lessons Learned

* The project scope was still ambitious for the hackathon timeframe
* Experimenting with new technologies was a valuable learning experience
* Learned to plan for simpler solutions while allowing room for future expansion

---

## Next Steps

* Connect the database fully (hook up POST endpoints)
* Implement location-based services
* Admin portal for colleges and student-only portals
* Add search capabilities
