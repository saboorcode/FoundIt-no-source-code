## Inspiration

College students often face the challenge of recovering lost items and finding their rightful owners. Existing solutions are scattered across platforms like Snapchat and Reddit, with no unified approach. **FoundIt** was born to unify this process, offering a simple, cross-platform hub for campuses to post, track, and recover lost items.

---

## What It Does

FoundIt provides a one-stop place for posting and recovering lost or found items in an easy-to-use interface.

**Current Features (Simplified for Hackathon Time Constraints):**

* View a list of actively lost items
* Add a lost item to the list
* View your posted items

*(Future goal: mark items as found or inactive.)*

---

## Future Vision

* **Target Audience:** College campuses
* **Student Portal Authentication:** Admin accounts for colleges and student sign-ups through student email addresses
* **Location-Based Services:** Add location to lost items to improve recovery chances
* **Search Functionality:** Filter and search for lost items easily
